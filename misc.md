   I have Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD). It is a developmental disorder whose symptoms start in childhood(specifically from 3 to 7 years old). [Here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzBixSjmbc8eFl6UX5_wWGP8i0mAs-cvY) is a series of video to help you understand what ADHD is.

   When I am not working I watch movies. I have recorded more than 1500 movies as watched on IMDB and other websites. I write reviews on my telegram channel.
