I have Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD). It is a developmental disorder whose symptoms start in childhood(specifically from 3 to 7 years old). If you feel confused reading these, you will be given a detailed explanation. If you already looked away, be aware that you may be an undiagnosed ADHDer(just kidding).

When we talk about mental illness there are different ways of division. A major one is to divide all of them into two categories, pathological disorders, and developmental disorders. Developmental means the patients will develop behaviors that are not appropriate for their age and will impair their behavior after they become adults if they were not diagnosed and corrected in childhood. Therefore, developmental disorders, such as ADHD, are 100% quantitative illnesses. They are traits that like height and weight, which means one can say that she/he/they have x% of ADHD, where x ranges from 0 to 100. On the contrary, the mental diseases which lie in the spectrum of pathological are often 100% qualitative. You have schizophrenia or you do not have it. You have bipolar or you do not have it. You have major depression or you do not have it.

Getting back to ADHD itself, we should at first know that the definition is not indicated very well in the title.
