Howdy Ho! I am currently a Research Assistant in UPMC. I am currently working with Prof. Jiantao Pu. I received MSc in ECE from UPitt Swanson under the supervision of Dr. Liang Zhan and a bachelor's degree in engineering from the ECE department at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC). Before my MS studies, I was blessed to work with Prof. Yang Yang at UESTC.

My work mainly revolves around information retrieval and computer vision by designing attention-based frameworks in single-modal/multi-modal scenarios, as well as meta-learning. I am also interested in exploring the meaning of attention through explainable AI methods.
